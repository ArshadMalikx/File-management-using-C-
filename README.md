# 📁 Real FileSystem Emulator in C++

A **Unix-like FileSystem Emulator** written in **C++17** that performs **real operations** directly on your local filesystem. Unlike virtual filesystems, this emulator interacts with your actual directories and files.

> ⚠️ Runs on your real file system. Use in a safe/sandbox folder to avoid accidental data loss.

---

## 🚀 Features

- 📂 Directory Operations: `mkdir`, `cd`, `pwd`, `ls`, `rmdir (recursive)`
- 📄 File Operations: `touch`, `rm`, `read`, `write`, `overwrite`
- 💻 Interactive Shell: Shows current working directory as prompt
- ❌ Error Handling: Friendly and clear error messages
- 🧩 Cross-Platform: Powered by `std::filesystem` from C++17
- 🧼 RAII-Compliant: Automatic resource management
